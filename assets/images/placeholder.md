# Image Directory

This directory will store blog post images and author avatars.

Place your image files here:

- Featured images: like `docker-guide.jpg` and `k8s-vs-swarm.jpg` referenced in blog posts
- Author avatars: like `admin-avatar.jpg`
- Default images: `default-avatar.png`, `default-post-image.jpg`, `default-featured.jpg`

This placeholder file is just to ensure the directory is created in Git.
