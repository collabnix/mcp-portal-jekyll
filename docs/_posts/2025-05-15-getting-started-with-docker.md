## Introduction to Docker

Docker is a platform that enables developers to build, ship, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient environments that include everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.

In this guide, we'll walk through the fundamentals of Docker and how to get started with containerizing your applications.

## Why Use Docker?

- **Consistency**: Run the same application with the same environment across different machines
- **Isolation**: Keep applications and their dependencies separate from each other
- **Portability**: Build once, run anywhere
- **Efficiency**: Containers share the host OS kernel, making them more lightweight than VMs
- **Scalability**: Easily scale applications horizontally

## Installing Docker

To get started with Docker, you'll need to install Docker Desktop (for Windows and Mac) or Docker Engine (for Linux).

### For Windows and Mac:

1. Download Docker Desktop from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts
3. Start Docker Desktop

### For Linux (Ubuntu):

```bash
# Update package index
sudo apt-get update

# Install dependencies
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release

# Add Docker's official GPG key
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

# Set up the stable repository
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# Install Docker Engine
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

# Verify installation
sudo docker run hello-world
```

## Docker Basics

### Images and Containers

- **Image**: A read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container
- **Container**: A runnable instance of an image

### Basic Docker Commands

```bash
# Pull an image from Docker Hub
docker pull ubuntu

# List all images
docker images

# Create and start a container
docker run -it ubuntu bash

# List running containers
docker ps

# List all containers (including stopped ones)
docker ps -a

# Stop a container
docker stop <container_id>

# Remove a container
docker rm <container_id>

# Remove an image
docker rmi <image_id>
```

## Creating Your First Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app/

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Building and Running Your Docker Image

```bash
# Build an image from a Dockerfile
docker build -t my-python-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 4000:80 my-python-app
```

## Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

### Example docker-compose.yml

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - .:/code
    environment:
      FLASK_ENV: development
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
```

### Basic Docker Compose Commands

```bash
# Start services defined in docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up

# Start services in detached mode
docker-compose up -d

# Stop services
docker-compose down

# View logs
docker-compose logs
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use official images** as base whenever possible
2. **Minimize layers** in your Dockerfile to reduce image size
3. **Don't run containers as root** for security
4. **Use .dockerignore** to exclude unnecessary files
5. **Tag your images** properly for version control
6. **Use multi-stage builds** to create smaller production images

## Conclusion

Docker has revolutionized how developers build, ship, and run applications. By containerizing your applications, you can ensure they run consistently across different environments, from development to production.

As you become more comfortable with Docker, you can explore more advanced topics like Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and container orchestration platforms.

Happy containerizing!
